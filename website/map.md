# Interactive Ocean Map

Welcome to BlueSphere's interactive ocean monitoring platform. Our advanced mapping system provides real-time access to global ocean temperature data, marine observations, and environmental insights.

## Features

- **Real-time Temperature Data**: Live sea surface temperature measurements from global buoy networks
- **Historical Analysis**: Explore decades of ocean temperature trends and anomalies  
- **Marine Heatwave Tracking**: Identify and monitor extreme temperature events
- **Station Network**: Access data from over 1,000 monitoring stations worldwide

## How to Use

1. **Navigate the Map**: Use zoom and pan controls to explore different ocean regions
2. **Select Stations**: Click on buoy markers to view detailed temperature data
3. **Time Analysis**: Use the temporal controls to see how conditions change over time
4. **Export Data**: Download station data for further analysis

## Data Sources

Our platform integrates multiple authoritative ocean datasets:
- **NOAA NDBC**: National Data Buoy Center observations
- **ERSST**: Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature
- **Argo Floats**: Global ocean profiling program
- **TAO/TRITON**: Tropical atmosphere ocean buoys

## Access the Interactive Map

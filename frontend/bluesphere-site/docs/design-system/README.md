# BlueSphere Design System

## Overview

The BlueSphere Design System provides a comprehensive foundation for creating consistent, accessible, and professional user interfaces across the ocean monitoring platform. This system is designed to support the critical mission of climate action through clear data visualization and intuitive user experiences.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Scientific Accuracy**
Every design decision supports accurate data representation and scientific credibility. Visual hierarchies prioritize data integrity and minimize interpretation errors.

### 2. **Accessibility First** 
All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring the platform serves diverse users including researchers with disabilities, international audiences, and users in various environments.

### 3. **Professional Trust**
The design system establishes credibility with scientists, policymakers, and activists through professional aesthetics that convey authority and reliability.

### 4. **Ocean-Inspired**
The visual language draws from ocean patterns, colors, and movements while maintaining clarity and avoiding decorative elements that could interfere with data comprehension.

### 5. **Performance-Focused**
All design patterns optimize for fast loading, smooth animations, and efficient rendering of large datasets across devices and network conditions.

## System Architecture

### Design Tokens
- **Colors**: Temperature-mapped palettes, semantic colors, and accessibility-compliant contrasts
- **Typography**: Information hierarchy optimized for data visualization
- **Spacing**: Consistent rhythm based on 4px grid system
- **Animation**: Purpose-driven motion that enhances usability

### Components
- **Foundation**: Layout, grid, containers
- **Navigation**: Headers, breadcrumbs, pagination
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, maps, legends, controls
- **Forms**: Inputs, buttons, validation
- **Feedback**: Alerts, modals, tooltips

### Patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Automatic and manual theme switching
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex data presented in manageable layers
- **Interactive States**: Clear feedback for all user actions

## Quick Start

1. **Import Design System**
   ```tsx
   import { colors, Button, H1, H2, P } from '../components/DesignSystem'
   ```

2. **Use Global Styles**
   ```tsx
   import '../styles/globals.css'
   ```

3. **Apply Responsive Classes**
   ```tsx
   <div className="bs-container bs-main">
   ```

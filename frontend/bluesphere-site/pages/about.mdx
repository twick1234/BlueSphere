# About BlueSphere

BlueSphere exists to turn **ocean data into collective action** — mapping temperatures and currents, helping people learn, and supporting sustainable decisions.

## Our Mission
- Make ocean temperature & current data **accessible, explorable, and explainable**.
- Enable educators, students, policymakers, and citizen scientists to **see trends**, **ask questions**, and **co-create solutions**.
- Build an open platform that supports **predictive models** and **local action**.

## Environmental Goals
- Track **warming trends** and **marine heatwaves**, highlighting risk to ecosystems and coasts.
- Reveal **current patterns** that influence fisheries, coral bleaching, and extreme weather.
- Share **education modules** and **community science** tools to build stewardship.
- Publish open APIs so others can **build climate tools** on top of BlueSphere.

## Data Sources (open & reputable)
- **NDBC** (buoy observations; water temperature WTMP)
- **ERSST v5** (monthly gridded sea-surface temperature)
- **ERDDAP** hosts (e.g., NOAA CoastWatch) for additional datasets
- Roadmap: OSCAR surface currents, Argo floats, satellite SST, and more.

> See `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` and `docs/DATA_LICENSES.md` for details and usage terms.

## What’s Inside the App
- **Interactive global map** — SST heatmaps + vector currents (pan/zoom; desktop & mobile)
- **Daily updates** — CI jobs rebuild tiles and refresh sources
- **APIs** — `/stations`, `/obs`, `/obs/summary`, and tile endpoints
- **Learning** — a growing library of explainers and classroom-ready content
- **Transparency** — public roadmap, docs, and open-source code

## Brand Story
BlueSphere’s mark — a **globe wrapped by currents** — reflects movement and connection.  
Our palette draws from the **deep ocean** and **bright aquas**, signaling **optimism** and **clarity**.

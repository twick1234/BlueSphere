# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest tagged release of BlueSphere. Security fixes will be backported where feasible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, email us at **security@bluesphere.org** with details. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work with you to resolve the issue responsibly.

## Guidelines
- Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, impact, potential fixes).
- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we have released a fix and coordinated an advisory.

Thank you for helping keep BlueSphere safe and secure.

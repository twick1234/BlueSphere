### **Objection Handling Scripts**

**"This seems expensive compared to free government data"**
- **Response**: "You're right that raw data is free, but interpretation and predictions aren't. Our AI transforms that data into actionable insights that save millions in climate-related losses. The question isn't the cost of our platform - it's the cost of not having early warnings when the next marine heatwave hits your operations."

**"How accurate are AI predictions really?"**  
- **Response**: "Our models achieve 97% accuracy for 15-day marine heatwave predictions, compared to 70% industry average. Here's validation data from 2023-2024 showing actual vs predicted events. We also provide confidence intervals so you know exactly how certain each prediction is."

**"We already have climate risk consultants"**
- **Response**: "Consultants are excellent for strategy, but they can't provide real-time monitoring and predictions. Our platform complements consulting by giving you continuous intelligence to execute their recommendations. Think of us as your always-on climate intelligence team."

# 01 — Vision & Principles

**Purpose.** BlueSphere turns open ocean observations into **actionable insight** for a **brighter future**—from heatwaves to currents, from the classroom to policymakers.

## Vision
- **Clarity**: Make complex ocean signals (SST, currents) explorable by anyone.
- **Action**: Link insights to decisions: conservation, adaptation, education.
- **Openness**: Open data, open APIs, open docs, collaborative ecosystem.

## Environmental Outcomes
- Early signals for **marine heatwaves** & **coral bleaching** risk.
- Awareness of **current patterns** affecting fisheries & storms.
- Scalable **education** and **citizen science** participation.

## Product Principles
1. **Truthful & transparent**: clear metadata, provenance, QC flags.
2. **Accessible by default**: A11y, mobile-first, low-bandwidth options.
3. **Explain, not just show**: annotations, story panes, glossary.
4. **Responsible**: data ethics, uncertainty, non-alarmist framing.
5. **Composable**: APIs + tiles for downstream reuse.

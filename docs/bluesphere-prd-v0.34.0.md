## 1. Vision & Purpose
BlueSphere exists to transform **ocean temperature and current data** into **accessible, actionable insights**.  
By making buoy observations and global SST datasets open, explorable, and interactive, BlueSphere empowers **scientists, policymakers, educators, and citizens** to understand climate trends, anticipate risks, and co-create solutions for a **sustainable future**.

Our mission:  
🌊 **Data for good** — democratize access to reliable ocean climate data.  
🌍 **Brighter future** — link data insights to real-world sustainability action.  
📚 **Education & empowerment** — help learners of all ages explore oceans interactively.  

---

## 2. User Personas
- **Marine Scientists** → track SST anomalies, heatwaves, and coral reef risks.  
- **Policy Makers / NGOs** → use predictive insights to guide climate adaptation and conservation.  
- **Educators & Students** → explore dynamic ocean maps, learn about climate change impacts, and engage with interactive lessons.  
- **Citizen Scientists** → visualize buoy data, contribute observations, and raise awareness.  
- **Developers** → build apps and dashboards using BlueSphere APIs.

---

## 3. Use Cases
- Visualize **real-time buoy temperatures** and **historical SST trends**.  
- Overlay **currents and anomalies** on interactive maps to understand flow dynamics.  
- Zoom into specific regions (e.g., Indo-Pacific warm pool, Great Barrier Reef).  
- Download data or query via API (`/stations`, `/obs`, `/summary`).  
- Educators embed **dynamic visualizations** into classrooms.  
- NGOs run **predictive models** for ecosystem impact.  
- Citizens explore **marine life overlays** and ask questions via **chatbot**.

## 4. Product Features

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Ingest NDBC buoy data, ERSST v5 SST anomalies, ERDDAP feeds.  
- Normalize data into Postgres with daily auto-update pipeline.  
- Expose APIs: `/stations`, `/obs`, `/summary`.  
- Render global **interactive map** with SST heatmaps + currents (zoom/pan).  
- Web app with search, filters, timeline scrubbing.  
- Auto-update pipeline (CI/CD) to refresh daily.  
- Documentation: Data dictionary, API reference, tutorials.  

### Phase 2 (Enhancements)
- **Predictive modeling** → forecast SST anomalies, current shifts, ecosystem impacts.  
- **Marine overlays** → coral bleaching risk, fisheries, marine-protected areas.  
- **Chatbot/Q&A** → natural language access for students and public.  
- **Education mode** → curated stories, learning paths, quizzes.  
- **Community features** → share snapshots, annotate maps, crowdsource insights.

### Phase 3 (Ecosystem)
- Full **open API ecosystem** with SDKs.  
- Partner integrations (NGOs, research institutes).  
- Data fusion: Argo floats, OSCAR currents, multi-sensor SST.  
- Scalability → global adoption with resilient infrastructure.  
- Policy dashboards for climate adaptation.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Map tile loads < 1s, API latency < 300ms.  
- **Scalability**: Handle 100k+ DAU with global CDN.  
- **Data Freshness**: Daily updates (buoy/hourly, ERSST/monthly).  
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime via CI/CD & monitoring.  
- **Transparency**: Open-source repo, changelogs, docs.  
- **Sustainability**: Efficient compute/storage, green cloud targets.  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile-friendly.  

---

## 6. Roadmap Alignment
- **Phase 1** → ingestion, APIs, maps (Q1–Q2).  
- **Phase 2** → predictive modeling, chatbot, education modules (Q3–Q4).  
- **Phase 3** → ecosystem, integrations, research partnerships (2026+).  

---

## 7. Metrics & KPIs
- **Data coverage**: % of buoy stations ingested.  
- **System uptime**: 99.9% SLA.  
- **User engagement**: daily active users, session duration.  
- **Learning impact**: # of educators using classroom mode.  
- **Sustainability outcomes**: # of NGOs/policy actions influenced.  
- **Open engagement**: API calls per month, community contributions.  

---

## 8. Dependencies
- NOAA NDBC, ERSST v5, ERDDAP (public datasets).  
- Postgres, FastAPI, Next.js, Mapbox/Leaflet.  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.  
- CDN + hosting for scalability.  

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations
- **Data gaps** → use ERDDAP as fallback, flag missing data.  
- **Scalability** → deploy caching/CDN early.  
- **Complexity of predictive models** → partner with climate science orgs.  
- **Adoption** → mitigate with education-first UX, clear branding, open APIs.

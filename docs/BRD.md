# BlueSphere Climate Action Platform Requirements

## üåç URGENT MISSION: SAVING OUR OCEANS
**BlueSphere exists to expose the climate emergency in our oceans and mobilize urgent global action. This is not about profit - this is about survival.**

Our oceans are dying. Marine heatwaves are destroying coral reefs. Sea levels are rising. Ocean currents that regulate our climate are failing. **We have less than a decade to act.**

## üî• THE CRISIS WE'RE ADDRESSING
- **Marine heatwaves** have increased 20x since the 1980s
- **50% of coral reefs** have been lost to bleaching  
- **Ocean temperatures** are rising faster than ever recorded
- **Critical climate data** is scattered, inaccessible, ignored

## üéØ OUR RESPONSE: DEMOCRATIZE OCEAN INTELLIGENCE
BlueSphere transforms complex ocean data into **undeniable climate truth** that drives immediate action.

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Climate Activists & NGOs**: Need compelling data for campaigns
- **Policy Makers**: Need clear evidence for emergency legislation  
- **Scientists**: Need unified global datasets for research
- **Citizens**: Need to understand the crisis in their backyard
- **Youth**: Need tools to demand climate action from leaders

### Success Metrics (Not Revenue)
- **Climate Action Triggered**: Policies changed, protests organized, funding redirected
- **Data Democratization**: Scientists using platform for critical research
- **Public Awakening**: Citizens understanding ocean crisis in their region
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Communities preparing for sea level rise/storms
- **Global Collaboration**: International data sharing and cooperation

## 4. Scope
- Data platform (APIs, tiles, ingestion) + Public website (education, Q&A, stories).

## 5. Value Propositions
- One platform: from raw data ‚Üí decision-ready insight.
- Predictive ocean currents & anomalies to guide **sustainable fisheries**, **renewable siting**, **MPAs**, and **coastal resilience**.

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions
- Prefer open data and open-source tools. Operate on low-cost or free tiers initially.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- Data outages ‚Üí mirrors & retries. Misinterpretation ‚Üí clear uncertainty & education. Cost growth ‚Üí caching & static tiles.

## 8. Governance
- Open governance (MIT). Advisory board (NGO/science/engineering). Quarterly roadmap reviews.

## 9. Rollout & Adoption
- Pilot with NGO/university partners. Launch education hub and story mode. Expand with alerts and embeddable widgets.
